# Retinal-Image-Analysis
This repository contains my work for the project 'Retinal Image Analysis Using Deep Learning'<br>
The colab file shared performs image segmentation using the Attention-UNet Model. Thus we can get an idea about the vessel structure of the retina.<br>
Such a system will be highly beneficial to opthalmologists, and aid them in deciding if a person is suffering from any eye related disease. For more details, you can read the [report](https://github.com/chakshu-dhannawat/Retinal-Image-Analysis/blob/main/Retinal%20Image%20Analysis%20Report.pdf) attached.
