# Retinal-Image-Analysis
This repository contains my work for the project 'Retinal Image Analysis Using Deep Learning'<br>
The project involved many aspects of medical image analysis, such as information retrieval from low quality images. Using Image Augmentation Methods for dataset having low number of images and using Image Enhancement techniques.<br>
The colab file shared performs image segmentation using the Attention-UNet Model. Thus we can get an idea about the vessel structure of the retina.<br>
Such a system will be highly beneficial to opthalmologists, and aid them in deciding if a person is suffering from any eye related disease. For more details, you can read the [report](https://github.com/chakshu-dhannawat/Retinal-Image-Analysis/blob/main/Retinal%20Image%20Analysis%20Report.pdf) attached.
